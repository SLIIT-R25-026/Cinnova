# Cinnamon Plant Health Monitoring System

## 1. Main Objective

Develop a mobile-based solution to detect and classify diseases and nutritional deficiencies in cinnamon plants, predict disease severity, and identify the maturity of cinnamon trees. The system aims to enhance early detection, proper disease management, and improve the overall productivity and quality of cinnamon cultivation.



## 2. Main Research Questions
- How can machine learning and deep learning models be effectively used to detect various diseases, nutrient deficiencies, and maturity stages in cinnamon plants?
- What models and techniques provide the most accurate predictions with minimal computational resources suitable for mobile deployment?
- How can we provide actionable remedies and guidance to cinnamon farmers based on predictions?
- How can we improve the accuracy of detecting diseases in cinnamon  bark using images?        
- How can AI and image processing identify the quality assessment of cinnamon flowers, barks?
